        <p>There are many heating companies serving Gravesend, but homeowners consistently choose Hixa Heating for our combination of local expertise, exceptional service, and competitive pricing.

Our engineers live in the community we serve, and we rely on word-of-mouth recommendations from satisfied customers rather than expensive advertising.</p>

        <h2>Emergency Boiler Repairs Across Gravesend</h2>
        <p>When your boiler breaks down and you're left without heating or hot water, you need a local company that can respond quickly and get you back up and running fast. That's exactly what Hixa Heating provides to homeowners across Gravesend – rapid emergency response, expert diagnosis, and professional repairs carried out to the highest standards.</p>

        <p>Our Gas Safe registered engineers are highly experienced in repairing all makes and models of boilers, from the latest Worcester Bosch and Vaillant models to older systems from manufacturers like Potterton, Ideal, and Baxi. We carry a comprehensive stock of common spare parts in our vans, which means we can often complete repairs on the first visit without delays waiting for parts to be ordered.</p>

        <h3>Common Boiler Problems in Gravesend:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Heating or Hot Water:</strong> Often caused by faulty thermostats, broken diverter valves, or failed ignition components</li>
            <li><strong>Boiler Losing Pressure:</strong> Usually due to leaks in the system or bleeding radiators – we'll find and fix the source</li>
            <li><strong>Kettling and Strange Noises:</strong> Common in Gravesend due to hard water causing limescale buildup on the heat exchanger</li>
            <li><strong>Leaking Boiler:</strong> Can indicate worn seals, corroded components, or excessive pressure – requires immediate attention</li>
            <li><strong>Pilot Light Problems:</strong> Faulty thermocouples or gas valve issues preventing reliable ignition</li>
            <li><strong>Frozen Condensate Pipe:</strong> A common winter problem in Gravesend – we can thaw and insulate to prevent recurrence</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We understand that boiler breakdowns are stressful and inconvenient, especially during cold weather or when you have young children or elderly relatives at home. That's why we prioritize emergency callouts and aim to have an engineer at your Gravesend property as quickly as possible, often the same day for genuine emergencies.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, a repair isn't economically viable, particularly for older boilers where parts are expensive or unavailable. In these cases, we'll give you honest advice about whether repair or replacement makes more sense for your situation, with transparent pricing for both options. We'll never recommend an unnecessary boiler replacement just to make a sale – our reputation depends on honest, trustworthy advice.</p>

        <h2>Annual Boiler Servicing in Gravesend</h2>
        <p>Regular annual boiler servicing is essential for all Gravesend homeowners, yet many people overlook this important maintenance task until problems develop. At Hixa Heating, we provide comprehensive boiler servicing throughout Gravesend from just £80, helping you maintain efficiency, prevent breakdowns, and ensure your family's safety.</p>

        <p>Our thorough service takes 45-60 minutes and includes a complete inspection of your boiler and heating system. We check all key components including the heat exchanger, burner, ignition, seals, and safety devices. We perform professional flue gas analysis to verify combustion efficiency and ensure there are no carbon monoxide issues. You'll receive a detailed written report with any recommendations for repairs or improvements.</p>

        <h3>Why Annual Servicing is Crucial in Gravesend:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hard Water Protection:</strong> Gravesend has hard water which can cause limescale buildup. Regular servicing helps identify and address this before it causes expensive damage</li>
            <li><strong>Maintain Warranty:</strong> Most boiler manufacturers require annual servicing to keep warranties valid. Without service records, warranty claims will be rejected</li>
            <li><strong>Prevent Breakdowns:</strong> Most boiler failures are preventable through regular maintenance. Annual servicing catches small issues before they become major problems</li>
            <li><strong>Improve Efficiency:</strong> A well-maintained boiler can be up to 10% more efficient, saving you money on heating bills every year</li>
            <li><strong>Safety First:</strong> Annual checks ensure your boiler is operating safely with no risk of carbon monoxide leaks</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirement for Landlords:</strong> If you're a Gravesend landlord, annual gas safety checks are legally required for all rental properties</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We can set up annual service reminders so you never forget when your boiler is due for its next check. Many of our Gravesend customers book their service at the same time each autumn, ensuring their boiler is ready for winter when it's needed most.

        <h2>Landlord Services in Gravesend</h2>
        <p>If you're a landlord with rental properties in Gravesend, you have a legal obligation to ensure all gas appliances are safe and checked annually by a Gas Safe registered engineer. At Hixa Heating, we provide efficient, professional landlord gas safety checks and CP12 certificates throughout Gravesend, helping you meet your legal requirements and protect your tenants.</p>

        <p>We understand that managing rental properties can be challenging, especially if you have multiple properties or tenants across different locations in Gravesend.

We can arrange access directly with your tenants if needed, complete inspections quickly to minimize disruption, and provide same-day certification in most cases.</p>

        <h2>Boiler Upgrade Grants & Finance in Gravesend</h2>
        <p>We understand that a new boiler is a significant investment, and not all Gravesend homeowners have £2,000-£5,000 readily available. That's why we offer flexible finance options and can advise on any grants or schemes you might be eligible for.</p>

        <h3>Finance Options:</h3>
        <p>We work with leading finance providers to offer flexible payment plans including 0% interest finance (subject to status) over 12-24 months, and low APR options for longer terms. Many Gravesend homeowners find that the monthly savings on energy bills from a new efficient boiler largely offset their finance payments, making the actual cost to household budgets very manageable.</p>

        <h3>Grants and Support:</h3>
        <p>While direct boiler replacement grants are limited, some Gravesend residents may be eligible for support through schemes like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Energy Company Obligation (ECO4) for low-income households</li>
            <li>Local authority grants for vulnerable residents</li>
            <li>Boiler Upgrade Scheme for heat pump installations (alternative to gas boilers)</li>
