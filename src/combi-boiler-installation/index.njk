        <h2>What Is a Combi Boiler?</h2>
        <p>A combination (combi) boiler is the UK's most popular type of boiler, providing both central heating and instant hot water without the need for a separate hot water cylinder or cold water tank. This makes them ideal for homes with limited space.</p>
        
        <h3>Benefits of Combi Boilers:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Space-Saving:</strong> No need for tanks in the loft or airing cupboard</li>
            <li><strong>Instant Hot Water:</strong> Hot water on demand, no waiting for tanks to heat up</li>
            <li><strong>Energy Efficient:</strong> Only heats water when you need it, reducing waste</li>
            <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Lower installation costs compared to system boilers</li>
            <li><strong>Better Water Pressure:</strong> Mains pressure hot water for powerful showers</li>
            <li><strong>Easier Installation:</strong> Simpler system means faster fitting</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Choosing the Right Combi Boiler Size</h2>
        <p>Selecting the correct combi boiler size is crucial for ensuring you have adequate heating and hot water in your home. Combi boilers are rated in kilowatts (kW), which indicates their output power. The right size depends on several factors including the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, radiators, and your property's insulation levels.</p>
        
        <p>For most homes in Gravesend, we typically recommend the following sizes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>24-28kW:</strong> Small homes, flats, or 1-2 bedroom properties with one bathroom</li>
            <li><strong>28-32kW:</strong> Medium-sized homes with 2-3 bedrooms and one bathroom</li>
            <li><strong>32-35kW:</strong> Larger 3-4 bedroom homes with 1-2 bathrooms</li>
            <li><strong>35-42kW:</strong> Large family homes with 4+ bedrooms and 2 bathrooms</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>During our free home survey, our experienced engineers will assess your property's heating requirements and recommend the perfect boiler size. An undersized boiler will struggle to meet your hot water demands, while an oversized boiler wastes energy and money. We ensure you get exactly what you need for optimal efficiency and comfort.</p>
        
        <p>We also consider your mains water pressure during our assessment, as combi boilers rely on good water pressure to deliver hot water effectively. If your pressure is low, we can advise on solutions or recommend alternative boiler types that may be more suitable.</p>

        <h2>The Combi Boiler Installation Process</h2>
        <p>At Hixa Heating, we pride ourselves on providing professional, efficient combi boiler installations with minimal disruption to your daily life. Our comprehensive installation service is designed to ensure everything is completed to the highest standards, with full compliance with all relevant building regulations and safety requirements.</p>
        
        <p>The typical installation process takes 1-2 days, depending on the complexity of the job. Here's what you can expect:</p>
        
        <h3>Day 1: Removal and Installation</h3>
        <p>Our engineers arrive promptly at the agreed time and begin by protecting your property with dust sheets. We'll remove your old boiler system, including any tanks, cylinders, and associated pipework that are no longer needed. All waste is disposed of responsibly and legally. We then position and securely mount your new combi boiler, connect the gas supply, install the flue system, and connect all pipework for heating and hot water.</p>
        
        <h3>Day 2: System Flush and Commissioning</h3>
        <p>On the second day, we perform a thorough power flush of your heating system to remove sludge, rust, and debris that could damage your new boiler. We add central heating inhibitor to protect against future corrosion and install a magnetic filter (included as standard) to capture metal particles. The boiler is then commissioned, tested, and balanced to ensure optimal performance.</p>
        
        <p>Before we leave, we provide you with a full demonstration of how to operate your new boiler and controls, answer all your questions, hand over all certification including Gas Safe certificate and Building Regulations compliance, and register your manufacturer warranty. We also ensure your home is left clean and tidy.</p>

        <h2>Energy Efficiency and Savings</h2>
        <p>Modern combi boilers are significantly more energy efficient than older models, which can lead to substantial savings on your heating bills. If you're currently using a boiler that's 10-15 years old, upgrading to a new combi boiler could reduce your energy consumption by up to 30%, saving you hundreds of pounds per year on gas bills.</p>
        
        <p>All new combi boilers we install are A-rated for energy efficiency, achieving efficiency levels of 92-94%. This means that for every £1 you spend on gas, 92-94p is converted into useful heat for your home, with only 6-8p wasted. In contrast, old inefficient boilers may be only 60-70% efficient, wasting 30-40p of every pound spent on fuel.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Energy Efficiency Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Condensing Technology:</strong> Recovers heat from flue gases that would otherwise be wasted</li>
            <li><strong>Modulating Burners:</strong> Adjust flame size to match heating demand, reducing gas waste</li>
            <li><strong>Weather Compensation:</strong> Some models adjust output based on outside temperature</li>
            <li><strong>Smart Controls Compatible:</strong> Works with smart thermostats for optimized scheduling</li>
            <li><strong>Hot Water Priority:</strong> Ensures efficient hot water delivery on demand</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The Energy Saving Trust estimates that replacing a G-rated boiler (less than 70% efficient) with a new A-rated condensing combi boiler could save you £315-£395 per year on average. Over the typical 10-15 year lifespan of a boiler, that's potentially £3,150 to £5,925 in savings. Combined with smart controls and proper system maintenance through annual servicing, you can maximize your energy savings and reduce your carbon footprint.</p>

        <h2>Warranties and Guarantees</h2>
        <p>When you invest in a new combi boiler with Hixa Heating, you're protected by comprehensive manufacturer warranties and our commitment to quality workmanship. We're accredited installers for all major boiler brands, which means we can offer you the maximum warranty periods available—up to 12 years on selected models.</p>
        
        <h3>Manufacturer Warranties:</h3>
        <p>Different brands and models come with varying warranty periods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Worcester Bosch Greenstar 2000:</strong> 5-7 year parts and labour warranty with accredited installation</li>
            <li><strong>Worcester Bosch Greenstar 4000:</strong> 10 year parts and labour warranty with accredited installation</li>
            <li><strong>Worcester Bosch Greenstar 8000:</strong> 12 year parts and labour warranty with accredited installation</li>
            <li><strong>Vaillant ecoTEC Plus:</strong> 7-10 year warranty with Advance installation</li>
            <li><strong>Vaillant ecoTEC Exclusive:</strong> Up to 12 year warranty with Advance installation</li>
            <li><strong>Viessmann Vitodens:</strong> 7-10 year warranty depending on model</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>These extended warranties are only available when your boiler is installed by an accredited installer like Hixa Heating. Non-accredited installations typically receive only a standard 1-2 year warranty, leaving you exposed to expensive repair costs much sooner.</p>
        
        <h3>Our Installation Guarantee:</h3>
        <p>In addition to manufacturer warranties, we guarantee our workmanship. If any issues arise due to our installation work, we'll return to fix them free of charge. We also provide ongoing support and advice throughout the life of your boiler, and offer annual <a href="/boiler-service-repairs/">servicing packages</a> to keep your boiler running efficiently and maintain your warranty validity (most manufacturers require annual servicing to keep warranties active).</p>
        
        <p>Peace of mind is included with every installation. You can trust that your investment is protected for years to come.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Combi Boilers</h2>
        
        <h3>How long does a combi boiler last?</h3>
        <p>With proper annual servicing and maintenance, a quality combi boiler should last 10-15 years. Premium brands like Worcester Bosch and Vaillant often exceed this, with some lasting 20+ years. Regular servicing is essential to maximize lifespan.</p>
        
        <h3>Can I shower while someone uses hot water elsewhere?</h3>
        <p>Modern combi boilers have improved hot water flow rates, but there can be a slight drop in pressure when multiple hot water outlets are used simultaneously. For homes with high simultaneous demand (multiple bathrooms in use at once), a system boiler might be more suitable.</p>
        
        <h3>Do combi boilers work with power showers?</h3>
        <p>Combi boilers provide mains pressure hot water, so you don't need a separate power shower pump. In fact, you cannot use a power shower with a combi boiler. The mains pressure is usually sufficient for a powerful shower experience with a modern thermostatic mixer valve.</p>
        
        <h3>What size hot water cylinder do I need to remove?</h3>
        <p>One of the great benefits of switching to a combi boiler is that you can remove your hot water cylinder completely, freeing up valuable space in your airing cupboard. You'll also be able to remove any cold water tanks from your loft. We handle all removal and disposal as part of our installation service.</p>
        
        <h3>Will I save money with a combi boiler?</h3>
        <p>Yes, if you're replacing an old inefficient boiler. New A-rated combi boilers are 92-94% efficient, compared to 60-70% for older models. This can save £300+ per year on gas bills. You'll also save money by not heating a full cylinder of hot water that you might not use.</p>
        
        <h3>How much does a combi boiler cost to run?</h3>
        <p>Running costs depend on your home size, insulation, and usage patterns. On average, a typical 3-bedroom home in the UK spends £700-£1,200 per year on gas for heating and hot water. A modern efficient combi boiler can reduce this by 20-30% compared to an old boiler.</p>
        
        <h3>Do I need to service my combi boiler every year?</h3>
        <p>Yes, annual servicing is essential and usually required to maintain your manufacturer warranty. An annual service costs from £80 and helps prevent breakdowns, maintains efficiency, ensures safety, and can identify minor issues before they become expensive problems. We offer <a href="/boiler-service-repairs/">annual service plans</a> for convenience and peace of mind.</p>
