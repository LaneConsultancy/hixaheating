        <h2>What Is a Combi Boiler?</h2>
        <p>A combination (combi) boiler is the UK's most popular type of boiler, providing both central heating and instant hot water without the need for a separate hot water cylinder or cold water tank. This makes them ideal for homes with limited space.</p>
        
        <h3>Benefits of Combi Boilers:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Space-Saving:</strong> No need for tanks in the loft or airing cupboard</li>
            <li><strong>Instant Hot Water:</strong> Hot water on demand, no waiting for tanks to heat up</li>
            <li><strong>Energy Efficient:</strong> Only heats water when you need it, reducing waste</li>
            <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Lower installation costs compared to system boilers</li>
            <li><strong>Better Water Pressure:</strong> Mains pressure hot water for powerful showers</li>
            <li><strong>Easier Installation:</strong> Simpler system means faster fitting</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Properties with 1-2 bathrooms</li>
