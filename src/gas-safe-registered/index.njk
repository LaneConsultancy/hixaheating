        <h2>What Does Gas Safe Registered Mean?</h2>
        <p>Gas Safe Register is the official gas registration body in the United Kingdom. It's a legal requirement that anyone working on gas appliances must be on the Gas Safe Register. This ensures they have the proper training and qualifications to work safely with gas.</p>
        
        <p><strong>It is illegal for anyone to carry out gas work unless they are Gas Safe registered.</strong> At Hixa Heating, all our engineers are fully qualified and registered with Gas Safe, giving you complete peace of mind.</p>
        
        <h3>Why Is Gas Safe Registration Important?</h3>

            <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Required by law for all gas work in the UK</li>
