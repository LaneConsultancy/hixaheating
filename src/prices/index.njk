        <h2>What Affects Boiler Installation Cost?</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Type of Boiler</h3>
        <p><a href="/combi-boiler-installation/">Combi boilers</a> are typically the most affordable option as they don't require a separate hot water cylinder or cold water tank. System and conventional boilers may cost more but are better suited to larger properties.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Boiler Brand & Model</h3>
        <p>Premium brands like <a href="/worcester-bosch-boiler-installers/">Worcester Bosch</a> and <a href="/vaillant-boiler-installers/">Vaillant</a> come with longer warranties (up to 12 years) and better energy efficiency, which saves money long-term.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Property Size</h3>
        <p>Larger homes require higher output boilers with more radiators and pipework, increasing the installation cost.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Installation Complexity</h3>
        <p>Additional costs may apply for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Relocating the boiler to a different room</li>
            <li>Upgrading gas pipes or electrical supply</li>
            <li>Installing a new flue system</li>
            <li>Removing old back boiler or converting from oil/LPG</li>
            <li>Adding a magnetic filter or scale reducer</li>
        </ul>
