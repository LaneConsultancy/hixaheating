        <h2>Types of Boilers We Install</h2>
        <p>Choosing the right type of boiler for your home is crucial for efficiency, comfort, and long-term cost savings. At Hixa Heating, we're experts in all three main types of domestic boilers, and we'll help you select the perfect system for your property. Here's a detailed guide to help you understand the differences between each type:</p>
        
        <h3>Combi Boilers (Combination Boilers)</h3>
        <p>Combi boilers are the most popular choice in the UK, and for good reason. These compact units provide both central heating and instant hot water on demand, without the need for a separate hot water cylinder or cold water storage tank. This makes them ideal for properties with limited space, such as flats, apartments, and smaller homes.</p>
        
        <p>The main advantages of <a href="/combi-boiler-installation/">combi boilers</a> include instant hot water whenever you turn on a tap, lower installation costs compared to system boilers, and excellent energy efficiency since they only heat water when you need it. They're perfect for homes with one or two bathrooms and good mains water pressure. Modern combi boilers are incredibly compact and can be fitted neatly in a kitchen cupboard, freeing up valuable storage space elsewhere in your home.</p>
        
        <p>However, combi boilers may not be suitable for larger properties with multiple bathrooms in simultaneous use, as the flow rate can be limited by your mains water pressure. If you have a large family or frequently use multiple taps and showers at once, a system boiler might be a better choice.</p>
        
        <h3>System Boilers</h3>
        <p>System boilers are designed for homes with higher hot water demands. They work with a hot water cylinder (usually stored in an airing cupboard) that stores a large volume of pre-heated water, ready for use whenever you need it. This makes them ideal for larger properties with multiple bathrooms, where several people might want to use hot water simultaneously.</p>
        
        <p>The key benefits of system boilers include the ability to supply hot water to multiple outlets at the same time without loss of pressure, compatibility with solar thermal systems for improved energy efficiency, and faster hot water delivery compared to heating water on demand. They're particularly well-suited to properties with 3+ bedrooms and 2+ bathrooms.</p>
        
        <p>System boilers require more space than combis due to the cylinder, but they don't need a cold water tank in the loft (unlike conventional boilers), making them more compact than traditional systems. They're an excellent middle-ground option for larger homes.</p>
        
        <h3>Conventional Boilers (Regular/Heat-Only Boilers)</h3>
        <p>Conventional boilers, also known as regular or heat-only boilers, are the traditional type of heating system that includes a boiler, hot water cylinder, and cold water storage tank (usually in the loft). While they're less common in new installations, they're sometimes the best option for certain properties.</p>
        
        <p>These boilers are ideal for homes with traditional heating systems, older properties with multiple bathrooms, and houses where several people might want to use hot water at the same time. They're also compatible with solar thermal panels and can be a good choice if you're replacing an existing conventional system, as the pipework and infrastructure are already in place.</p>
        
        <p>The main drawback is that they require the most space of all boiler types, and once the hot water cylinder is empty, you'll need to wait for it to reheat. However, for the right property, they can be the most reliable and practical solution.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Not sure which type is right for you?</strong> Our expert engineers will assess your property, discuss your hot water usage patterns, and recommend the perfect boiler type for your specific needs. We'll explain all your options clearly, with no jargon or pressure to make a quick decision.</p>

        <h2>Emergency Boiler Repairs & Breakdown Service</h2>
        <p>There's never a good time for your boiler to break down, but it always seems to happen at the worst possible moment – during a cold snap, when you have guests staying, or just before a holiday. That's why Hixa Heating offers a fast, reliable emergency boiler repair service throughout Gravesend and surrounding areas in Kent.</p>
        
        <p>Our Gas Safe registered engineers are experienced in diagnosing and repairing all makes and models of boilers, from modern condensing boilers to older traditional systems. We carry a comprehensive range of common spare parts in our vans, which means we can often complete repairs on the first visit, getting your heating and hot water back up and running as quickly as possible.</p>
        
        <h3>Common Boiler Problems We Fix:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No heating or hot water</strong> - We'll diagnose the cause quickly, whether it's a faulty component, electrical issue, or system problem</li>
            <li><strong>Boiler losing pressure</strong> - Often caused by leaks or bleeding radiators, we'll identify and fix the source</li>
            <li><strong>Leaking boiler</strong> - Can indicate various issues from worn seals to corroded components, requires immediate attention</li>
            <li><strong>Strange noises</strong> - Banging, whistling, or gurgling sounds can indicate kettling, air in the system, or failing components</li>
            <li><strong>Pilot light issues</strong> - If your pilot light keeps going out, we'll find and fix the underlying cause</li>
            <li><strong>Frozen condensate pipe</strong> - A common winter problem that we can resolve quickly and advise on prevention</li>
            <li><strong>Error codes and fault lights</strong> - Our engineers have extensive knowledge of all error codes and their solutions</li>
            <li><strong>Radiators not heating properly</strong> - Could be circulation issues, sludge buildup, or system balancing problems</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Sometimes, a boiler repair isn't economically viable, especially if your boiler is old, has multiple faults, or parts are no longer available. In these cases, we'll give you honest advice about whether a repair makes sense or if you'd be better off investing in a new boiler installation. We'll never recommend an unnecessary replacement – we'll always be upfront about your options and the costs involved.</p>
        
        <p>For peace of mind and to prevent unexpected breakdowns, we also offer annual <a href="/boiler-service-repairs/">boiler servicing</a> from just £80. Regular servicing can catch small issues before they become major problems, improve efficiency, reduce energy bills, and maintain your manufacturer warranty.</p>

        <h2>Annual Boiler Servicing - Protect Your Investment</h2>
        <p>Regular boiler servicing is one of the most important things you can do to keep your heating system running efficiently, safely, and reliably. At Hixa Heating, we recommend that all boilers are serviced annually by a qualified Gas Safe registered engineer. Our comprehensive boiler service checks every aspect of your system, identifies potential issues before they become expensive problems, and helps extend the life of your boiler.</p>
        
        <p>An annual boiler service typically takes around 45-60 minutes and includes a thorough inspection and testing of all key components. Our engineer will check the burner, heat exchanger, ignition, seals, and safety devices to ensure everything is working correctly. We'll also perform a flue gas analysis to measure combustion efficiency and ensure your boiler is operating at peak performance.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>Why Annual Servicing Is Essential:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Maintain Your Warranty</strong> - Most boiler manufacturers require annual servicing to keep warranties valid. Missing services could void your warranty coverage.</li>
                <li><strong>Improve Efficiency</strong> - A well-maintained boiler can be up to 10% more efficient, saving you money on energy bills year after year.</li>
                <li><strong>Prevent Breakdowns</strong> - Regular servicing catches small issues early, before they cause complete breakdowns at inconvenient times.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety First</strong> - Annual checks ensure your boiler is operating safely with no risk of carbon monoxide leaks or gas safety issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Extend Boiler Life</strong> - Properly maintained boilers last significantly longer than neglected ones, protecting your investment.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Requirement for Landlords</strong> - If you're a landlord, annual gas safety checks are a legal requirement.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>Our boiler servicing starts from just £80 and includes a detailed written report with any recommendations for repairs or improvements. We'll never pressure you into unnecessary work – if your boiler is in good condition, we'll tell you so. If we do identify any issues, we'll explain them clearly and provide transparent pricing for any recommended repairs.</p>
        
        <p>We can also set up annual service reminders so you never forget when your boiler is due for its next check. Many of our customers prefer to book their service at the same time each year (typically in autumn before the heating season begins), which helps ensure their boiler is ready for winter when it's needed most.</p>

        <h2>Energy Efficiency & Cost Savings</h2>
        <p>Upgrading to a new, energy-efficient boiler is one of the best investments you can make in your home. Modern boilers are significantly more efficient than older models, which means lower energy bills, reduced carbon emissions, and a more comfortable home. If your boiler is more than 10-15 years old, you could be wasting hundreds of pounds every year on unnecessary energy costs.</p>
        
        <p>All the boilers we install are A-rated condensing boilers with efficiency ratings of 90-94% or higher. This means that 90-94% of the fuel they use is converted into heat for your home, with minimal waste. In comparison, an old non-condensing boiler might only be 60-70% efficient, meaning you're literally throwing 30-40% of your energy (and money) out through the flue.</p>
        
        <h3>Potential Savings with a New Boiler:</h3>
        <p>According to the Energy Saving Trust, replacing an old G-rated boiler (less than 70% efficient) with a new A-rated condensing boiler could save you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>£395+ per year</strong> in a typical semi-detached home</li>
            <li><strong>£465+ per year</strong> in a detached home</li>
            <li><strong>£280+ per year</strong> in a mid-terrace home</li>
            <li><strong>£205+ per year</strong> in a flat or maisonette</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>These savings mean that a new boiler can often pay for itself within 5-8 years through reduced energy bills alone. When you factor in improved reliability, reduced repair costs, and the comfort of consistent heating and hot water, the return on investment is even more compelling.</p>
        
        <p>Beyond efficiency ratings, modern boilers offer smart controls and programmable thermostats that help you use energy more effectively. You can set different heating schedules for different times of day, control your heating remotely via smartphone apps, and receive notifications if something goes wrong. These features not only improve convenience but also help reduce energy waste and lower bills further.</p>
        
        <p>We're also happy to advise on additional energy-saving measures such as thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs), smart thermostats, heating system filters, and power flushing to improve overall system efficiency. Our goal is to help you create a heating system that's as efficient, economical, and environmentally friendly as possible.</p>

        <h2>Comprehensive Boiler Warranties & Guarantees</h2>
        <p>When you invest in a new boiler from Hixa Heating, you're not just buying a quality product – you're getting industry-leading warranties and guarantees that protect your investment for years to come. We're proud to offer some of the longest and most comprehensive warranty packages available in the heating industry.</p>
        
        <h3>Up to 12 Year Extended Warranties</h3>
        <p>As accredited installers for Worcester Bosch, Vaillant, and other leading manufacturers, we can offer extended warranties of up to 12 years on selected boiler models. This is significantly longer than the standard warranties typically offered with boiler installations, and it demonstrates both the quality of the products we install and our confidence in our workmanship.</p>
        
        <p>These extended warranties cover both parts and labour, which means if anything goes wrong with your boiler during the warranty period, you're fully protected. There are no hidden exclusions or complicated terms – just straightforward, comprehensive coverage that gives you complete peace of mind.</p>

                <h3>Worcester Bosch Warranties</h3>
                <p>As Worcester Bosch accredited installers, we can offer up to 12 years warranty on select Greenstar models when installed with a magnetic filter. Standard warranties range from 5-10 years depending on the model.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Vaillant Warranties</h3>
                <p>Vaillant offers up to 10 years warranty on their ecoTEC range when installed by an Advance installer like Hixa Heating. This includes both parts and labour coverage for complete protection.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Other Brands</h3>
                <p>We also offer competitive warranty packages on Viessmann, Baxi, Ideal, and other quality brands, typically ranging from 5-10 years depending on the manufacturer and model.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>It's important to note that these extended warranties are only available through accredited installers like Hixa Heating. If you buy a boiler from a non-accredited installer or attempt a DIY installation, you'll typically only get a 1-2 year manufacturer warranty – a fraction of what we can offer.</p>
        
        <h3>Our Installation Guarantee</h3>
        <p>In addition to manufacturer warranties, we also provide our own installation guarantee. We stand behind the quality of our work, and if any issues arise due to our installation (which is extremely rare), we'll put it right at no additional cost to you. Our reputation is built on customer satisfaction, and we'll always go the extra mile to ensure you're happy with your new boiler.</p>
        
        <p>All our installations are fully compliant with UK Building Regulations, and we provide all necessary certification including your Building Regulations notification and benchmark commissioning sheet. These documents are important for future property sales and insurance purposes.</p>

        <h2>Flexible Financing Options Available</h2>
        <p>We understand that a new boiler is a significant investment, and not everyone has the funds readily available to pay upfront. That's why Hixa Heating works with leading finance providers to offer flexible payment options that can make your new boiler more affordable and accessible.</p>
        
        <p>Our finance packages allow you to spread the cost of your new boiler installation over manageable monthly payments, rather than paying the full amount upfront. This means you can benefit from a warm, efficient home and lower energy bills immediately, while paying for your new boiler in affordable installments that fit your budget.</p>
        
        <h3>Finance Options Include:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>0% Interest Finance</strong> - Subject to status, available on selected packages over 12-24 months with no interest charges</li>
            <li><strong>Low APR Finance</strong> - Competitive interest rates for longer terms up to 5-10 years</li>
            <li><strong>No Deposit Options</strong> - Get your new boiler installed without any upfront payment (subject to approval)</li>
            <li><strong>Quick Online Application</strong> - Fast approval process with instant decisions in many cases</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible Terms</strong> - Choose a repayment period that suits your financial situation</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Finance is subject to status and credit checks, and terms and conditions apply. We work with established, FCA-regulated finance providers to ensure you're getting a fair and transparent deal. Our team can walk you through all the finance options available and help you find a package that works for your circumstances.</p>
        
        <p>It's worth considering that the energy savings from a new, efficient boiler can often offset a significant portion of your monthly finance payments. For example, if you save £35 per month on energy bills and your finance payment is £50 per month, your actual cost is only £15 per month – making a new boiler extremely affordable.</p>
        
        <p>To discuss finance options and get a personalized quote, simply contact us for a free, no-obligation consultation. We'll assess your needs, provide a written quote, and explain all payment options available to you.</p>

        <h2>The Importance of Gas Safe Registration</h2>
        <p>When it comes to gas work, safety is absolutely paramount. That's why it's a legal requirement in the UK that anyone working on gas appliances must be registered with Gas Safe Register, the official gas safety organization. At Hixa Heating, all our engineers are fully qualified, Gas Safe registered professionals who take safety extremely seriously.</p>
        
        <p><strong>It is illegal for anyone to carry out gas work unless they are on the Gas Safe Register.</strong> Working with unregistered individuals not only puts you and your family at serious risk but could also invalidate your home insurance and manufacturer warranties. Unfortunately, illegal gas work is more common than many people realize, which is why it's crucial to always check credentials before allowing anyone to work on your boiler or gas appliances.</p>
        
        <h3>Why Gas Safe Registration Matters:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Your Safety</strong> - Protects you from dangerous gas leaks, fires, explosions, and carbon monoxide poisoning</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Compliance</strong> - Required by law for all gas work in the UK; using unregistered workers is illegal</li>
            <li><strong>Insurance Protection</strong> - Many home insurance policies require Gas Safe registered engineers; otherwise claims may be invalid</li>
            <li><strong>Warranty Validity</strong> - Manufacturer warranties require installation and servicing by Gas Safe registered engineers</li>
            <li><strong>Building Regulations</strong> - All gas installations must comply with Building Regulations, enforced through Gas Safe</li>
            <li><strong>Professional Standards</strong> - Gas Safe engineers are regularly assessed, updated on latest standards, and carry proper insurance</li>
            <li><strong>Peace of Mind</strong> - Confidence that work is carried out safely, legally, and to the highest industry standards</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>When our engineer visits your property, they'll carry their Gas Safe ID card which shows their photo, registration details, and the types of gas work they're qualified to carry out. You have every right to ask to see this ID, and we encourage you to do so. You can also verify any engineer's registration online at the Gas Safe Register website (www.gassaferegister.co.uk) using their unique license number.</p>
        
        <p>Our Gas Safe registration number is displayed on all our paperwork, our vans, and our website. We're proud of our Gas Safe credentials and the peace of mind they provide to our customers. When you choose Hixa Heating, you're choosing a company that operates legally, safely, and to the absolute highest standards in the heating industry.</p>
